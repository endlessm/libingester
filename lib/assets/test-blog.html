            <p>Aqui no blog <a href="https://www.justlia.com.br/tag/casamento+disney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desde 2010 a gente mostrava as coleções Disney Fairy Tale Weddings</a> do designer<em> Alfredo Angelo</em> em parceria com a <strong>Disney</strong>.
                Por isso, fiquei triste com a notícia de que a marca declarou falência! Que coisa, né?!</p>
            <p>Mas não ficaremos carentes dessa inspiração de contos de fada, pois a marca japonesa <span aria-hidden="true"><em>Kuraudia Co.</em> acaba de fazer uma colaboração com 14 vestidos inspirados em 6 <strong>princesas Disney:</strong> Branca de Neve, Aurora, Cinderela, Bela, Ariel e Rapunzel.</span></p>
            <p>A recent study conducted by Nielsen Global Health and Wellness Survey reveals that millennials wish to lead a more wellness-oriented lifestyle as reflected on the way they spend on wholesome food and products to seeking activities that will
                help them achieve optimum health.</p>
            <p>To celebrate the strengths and passions of the millennials, Jeunesse Anion Sanitary Napkin and Liners recently launched two of the country’s inspiring millennial siblings—Christine and Clarice Patrimonio—as brand ambassadors.</p>
            <p>Their surname can be very familiar to many, as they are two of the four children of Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) Hall of Famer and movie personality Alvin Patrimonio, the very reason why they grew up in a family where sports and
                fitness is a serious affair. But compared to their father’s basketball career, the sisters have carved their own names in the field of tennis.</p>
            <h2>This is a header</h2>
            <p>While Clarice’s recent silver win in the 2017 South East Asian (SEA) Games in August has proven her athletic achievements and a strong presence on court, Christine played for the National University tennis team and earned medals in
                the University Athletic Association of the Philippines.</p>
            <h3>This is a subheader</h3>
            <p>Representing their school in several tennis tournaments locally and the country in international meets since they were young, the sisters naturally grew up to be achievers.</p>
